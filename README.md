A powerful Python package for inspecting and manipulating complex data structures such as dictionaries and lists. It features advanced recursive logic to deeply traverse nested structures, enabling robust search operationsâ€”such as value lookup, key/field search, key-value pair matching, and multi-condition filtering using operators like eq, match, gt, and, or, and more. The package also supports evaluating whether dictionaries meet custom conditions, with flexible targeting of fields and values at any depth.
